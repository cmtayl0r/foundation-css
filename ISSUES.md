# Design Token Accessibility & Best Practice Review (2025)

This document outlines potential issues and recommendations for improving the accessibility and best practices of the color token system, focusing on WCAG 2.2 AA compliance.

**Completed tasks from this review have been implemented and removed from this document.**

## 1. Simplify Spacing & Elevation Tokens

### Issue:

- **Spacing:** The [`styles/tokens/spacing.css`](styles/tokens/spacing.css) file contains over 20 static spacing variables. This level of granularity can lead to decision fatigue and inconsistent application.
- **Elevation:** The [`styles/tokens/elevation.css`](styles/tokens/elevation.css) file has a duplicate definition for `--z-index-sticky` and the numeric gaps between aliases are large but also not consistently spaced, which could lead to layering issues in complex apps.

### Recommendation:

- **Spacing:** Reduce the static scale to a core set of ~7-9 values based on the 8px grid (e.g., 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px). Rely more on the excellent fluid spacing tokens for responsive layouts.
- **Elevation:** Remove the duplicate `--z-index-sticky` definition. Re-evaluate the z-index scale to use a smaller, more deliberate set of values (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) and use `isolation: isolate` on components to create new stacking contexts where needed, which is a more modern approach than managing huge `z-index` values.

## Summary of Remaining Recommendations

1.  **Simplify the Spacing and Elevation token scales** to improve developer experience and prevent layering issues.
2.  **Continue adopting CSS Nesting** across the remaining project files.
3.  **Continue refactoring to CSS Logical Properties** across the remaining project files for automatic RTL language support.

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | 1. **Analyze Current State:** Review existing color primitives, semantics, and surface utilities.                                                                                                                                              | Completed   |
| 2   | 2. **Refactor Semantic States:** Streamline interactive state generation in `color-semantics.css` by defining interaction mix percentages as variables and creating a more robust, less repetitive system for hover, focus, and active states. | Completed   |
| 3   | 3. **Consolidate Interactive Utilities:** Refactor `surface-utilities.css` to group common styles for all interactive elements, reducing code repetition significantly.                                                                        | Completed   |
| 4   | 4. **DRY Up Manual Theme Overrides:** Eliminate code duplication in `color-semantics.css` for manual theme selectors to make them inherit from the base `:root` and media query definitions.                                                   | Completed   |
| 5   | 5. **Review & Finalize:** Present the final, refactored code for approval.                                                                                                                                                                     | In Progress |
